# Guess-it-1

The purpose of this project is to build a program that given a number as standard input, prints out a range in which the next number provided should be.This data represents a graph in which the values of the x axis are the number of the lines (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...) and the values of the y axis are the actual numbers (189, 113, 121, 114, 145, 110...).

Each of the numbers will be your standard input and the purpose of your program is for you to find the range in which the next number will be in. This range should have a space separating the lower limit from the upper one.
